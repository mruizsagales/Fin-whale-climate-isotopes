# Baleen stable isotopes reveal climate-driven behavioural shifts in North Atlantic fin whales

Climate variability determines structure and functioning of marine ecosystems and triggers behavioural responses in organisms. We investigated whether such variability modulates migration and diet in the North Atlantic fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus). To reconstruct the temporal changes in these aspects of the life cycle, we conducted stable isotope analysis of nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) along baleen plates from 29 fin whales sampled off NW Iceland in the summer. From the stable isotope oscillations observed along the baleens, we estimated a baleen growth rate of 16.1 ± 2.5 cm per year and assigned a date of deposition for each of the baleen segments, thus obtaining isotopic sequential time-series. We then investigated the potential association of these time series with the main climate indices affecting the North Atlantic basin. Baleen δ15N and δ13C values showed an association with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). During high AMO and low NAO periods, which tend to decrease krill abundance, there is an increase in both the mean and standard deviation of baleen δ15N values, suggesting that fin whales shift to higher trophic resources and expand their dietary niche. Additionally, high AMO periods, which relate to positive temperature anomalies, lead to a decrease in baleen δ13C values, suggesting that fin whales adjust their migratory routes and destinations towards higher latitudes. Significant variation in isotopic niche width between years also reflected these behavioural shifts. This highlights the plasticity of North Atlantic fin whale migratory and dietary behaviour, a trait likely to strengthen the resilience of the species within the current context of rapid and intense climate variability.
